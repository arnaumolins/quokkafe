Quokkafe application.

Connecting people through social networks and bringing them close to meet inside a physical location.
The requeriements implemented for this purpose are ranked in a **MoSCoW** organization.

The application is based on some operations that are defined as a **must**:
  - Completely functional user and password login and registration.
  - Show events and interverners meetings related to user interests.
  - Show events and interveners meetings not related to user interests through a search option.
  - Create a button “I’ll attend” / “Leave event” in order to know the users that will attend an event and list them.
  - Book a table and see the availability.
  - Interface with the characteristics of a user.
  
Once the must requirements are done, the application will improve with some operations that **should be**:
  - See the menu available in the café.
  - Make an order.

For high quality application we **could** apply:
  - An app website which contains information related to the business.
  - A friend feature to chat with other people.

The requirements the app **won’t** have:
  - A reward system managed with personal points.
  - Notifications to the customer when his order is ready.
